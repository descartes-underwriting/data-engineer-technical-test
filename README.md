# Descartes Underwriting

This repository contains the material for the data engineer recruitment test.

## Submission

If something is not clear, you can ask questions to the recruiter.

When submitting your project, your version should **not be draft** but complete and following best practices.

The solution should be saved on a **private** `descartes-data-eng` repository on your github account.

The solution should include:

- source code
- test code
- notebooks **with outputs**

When the final version is ready:

1. Send an email to the recruiter indicating that you finished the project and sharing the url of the project
2. Grant access to:

- <https://github.com/alexandreCameron>
- <https://github.com/mt94>
- <https://github.com/jd-rodriguez>
